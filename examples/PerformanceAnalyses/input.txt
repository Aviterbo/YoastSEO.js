What are the best colleges and universities in America considered geographically by state? In this ranking we present the best four-year liberal arts college and the best full-fledged university in each of the 50 states.

Most rankings of colleges and universities are top-heavy with schools from the East Coast (the Ivy League, MIT, etc.), California (Stanford, Cal Berkeley, etc.), and a few schools scattered throughout the rest of the country (University of Chicago, Vanderbilt, etc.).

In this ranking, we make geographical diversity our main focus, looking alas for the best education offered in each state, from Alabama to Wyoming.

Our criteria for putting a school on this list include the reputation of the school and its faculty, its dedication to a broad liberal arts education, its accreditation, and its overall academic caliber compared to other institutions of the same type within the same state.

<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-23764" src="http://thebestschools.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/hillsdale-university.jpg" alt="Hillsdale College" width="276" height="183" />Some states have an embarrassment of riches when it comes to institutions of higher learning (such as Massachusetts and California). In those cases, our job was not easy. Where two institutions were dominant—one primarily oriented towards the liberal arts and the other towards science and engineering—we went with the liberal arts school as offering a broader range of excellence across the curriculum (hence Harvard over MIT).

The result is a unique list of schools, two from each state, one a full-fledged research university, the other a college focused on undergraduate education. We believe this list identifies the very best that higher education has to offer across the length and breadth of this great land.

<em>Note:</em> For each state, we list the university first, and the liberal arts college second, regardless of alphabetical order. Also bear in mind that names can be misleading: Several of the institutions on our list that are essentially 4-year liberal arts colleges use the word “university” in their name. By the same token, one of our nation’s top research universities calls itself a “college” (see if you can spot it).

Established in 1856, Auburn University went through four names changes before settling on its current and longest-lasting title.

This public university sits on a sprawling 1,800-acre campus, complete with abundant student housing, dining, health services, counseling, and recreational facilities, among other amenities such as the 300 student-led organizations that meet on campus. Jordan-Hare Stadium, where the Auburn Tigers and mascot Aubie dominate the football field, is also located on campus.

While the school was originally focused on mainly agriculture and the arts, it now offers over 140 majors for students to choose from, 38 in the College of Liberal Arts alone. The university boasts a thriving student body of over 25,000 students and 1,200 faculty members. These numbers make it one of the largest universities in the state of Alabama.

Accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, auburn is considered one of the best, yet least-expensive, universities in the southeastern United States.

Stanford University, officially entitled Leland Stanford Junior University, is a private research university located in the Silicon Valley between San Francisco and San Jose. Founded in 1891, the university was established as a coeducational school with no denominational affiliations, which was rare at the time.

The rambling, 8,100-acre campus is located in suburban Stanford, and is a perfect mix of manicured lawns and unhampered vistas. Seeing that the current student body comprises 15,877 souls, each student theoretically has nearly half an acre all to him- or herself!

Speaking of the student body, unlike most of the colleges and universities on this list, Stanford is composed of more graduate students than undergraduates. This academic year’s enrollment included 8,897 of the former and only 6,980 of the latter. Stanford also boasts one of the most impressive faculty-to student-ratios in the county, with just five students to each faculty member.

The campus has over eighty different housing facilities to match the needs of the students. Last year 97 percent of undergraduates and 57 percent of graduate students lived on campus. There are also more than 650 student groups and 35 recognized religious groups to meet each student’s social and spiritual needs.

Stanford University is accredited by the Accrediting Commission of Senior Colleges and Universities of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges.

Founded in 1955, Harvey Mudd College is a private, coeducational liberal arts college focusing on engineering, science, and mathematics.

Purposely small at only 44.5 acres in suburban Claremont (about halfway between Pasadena and San Bernardino), and with between 700 and 800 students enrolled at any given time, the school is very selective. As a result, those admitted will reap the benefits of a nine-to-one student-to-faculty ratio.

Harvey Mudd College is a part of the Claremont University Consortium. This consortium is comprised of Harvey Mudd, four other colleges and two graduate institutions—respectively, Claremont McKenna College, Pitzer College, Pomona College, Scripps College, Claremont Graduate University, and Keck Graduate Institute for Applied Life Science. These colleges and universities remain autonomous, but allow their students to reap the benefits of the varied classes and amenities available at the affiliated campuses.

Harvey Mudd College offers degrees in biology, chemistry, computer science, engineering, mathematics, and physics. It also offers a number of joint or double major programs, for example pairing chemistry with biology, computer science with mathematics, and mathematics with biology.

Harvey Mudd College is accredited by the Accrediting Commission for Senior Colleges and Universities of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges.

In fact, the University of Denver (abbreviated as DU) is the oldest private university is the Rocky Mountain region. Originally founded as a Methodist seminary and still legally operating under the name Colorado Seminary, the university no longer adheres to any religious affiliation or teaches a specifically religious curriculum.

DU is the learning home of approximately 11,500 students and maintains a student-to-faculty ratio of 10-to-one. The 125-acre campus is located in a residential area seven miles from downtown Denver, and provides breathtaking views of the surrounding mountain ranges.

The university currently offers around 100 undergraduate programs and 120 graduate programs which are divided up across the eight colleges in the undergraduate program and twelve colleges in the graduate program.

Founded in 1874, Colorado College (CC) is a private liberal arts college located in Colorado Springs. The school currently offers 42 majors is fields such as anthropology, art, biology, Classics, education, and many others.

CC employs a highly unconventional way of teaching and learning. They call it the “block plan.” Instead of taking five or six classes simultaneously, as with most conventional learning plans, CC students take a single class for three weeks, complete it, and then move on to another class. Teachers only teach one class per block, so they can be fully committed to their students. This immersive environment promotes learning and long-term memory, rather than learning for the sake of testing.

The 90-acre campus is located in the heart of Colorado Springs, but is surrounded by unspoiled beauty. If you hope to travel during your undergraduate career, CC has one of the best and most varied study abroad programs in the country.

Part of the ultra-exclusive Ivy League, Yale is located in the old Long Island Sound port city of New Haven. The 837-acre campus (counting the on-campus golf course) is the centerpiece of the iconic town that is known for its greenery in the summer and its scenic snow scenes in the winter.

While contained on the same campus, Yale is split academically into three separate components:Yale College, which contains all the undergraduate programs; the Graduate Schools of Arts and Sciences; and the professional schools, including the medical and law schools.

According to <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report</em>, Yale University is ranked #3 among the universities in the U.S. for 2014, and the <em>Times</em> of London ranks it at #11 globally.

Yale also has one of the most highly respected athletic programs in the country and currently maintains 35 varsity level teams. However, if you are hoping to get a break on tuition thanks to your skills on the court or the field, Yale may not be the school for you—it offers no athletic scholarships.

It also offers interdisciplinary majors, which allow students to essentially custom-tailor their degree to match their individual goals and interests.

Connecticut College also offers excellent financial aid packages; nearly half the students receive some financial aid, and the average financial aid award package is around $35,000. The college’s dedication to educational excellence has not gone unnoticed: <em>Forbes</em> has listed the college #78 in the country among private colleges and #103 overall.

The 144-acre campus is located on Sarasota’s north bay front, just a few miles from the city center, and is an amiable, eclectic mix of new structures and recognized historical buildings, adding to the college’s southern charm.

The New College of Florida is known for its dedication to students as individuals. The school strives to provide the best education for each student and to meet students’ intellectual needs by creating specialized education plans, providing narrative evaluations, and straying from the traditional grading scale—opting instead for a pass/fail system.

In order to successfully graduate, students must complete seven contracts with their faculty adviser. These contracts are made at the beginning of a grading period and are based on the individual student’s specific goals. There are currently 825 enrolled students and the average class size is 17 students. The college maintains a 10-to-one student-to-faculty ratio.

Due to the university’s attention to detail and willingness to create student specific degrees, <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report</em> ranked the New College of Florida #5 on their list of best public liberal art schools.

The New College of Florida is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges.

The CCL campus itself is the oldest in the state and contains an arboretum that is home to over 300 species of plants. The student body is made up of primarily undergraduates: There are 680 undergraduates, and only 107 graduate students. The current student-to-faculty ratio is nine-to-one.

In an effort to create an environment of camaraderie, CCL requires all undergraduate students, with the exception of graduating seniors, to live on campus. To further create bonds between students, the college has formed what it calls “living-learning communities.” These residential halls are specialized, grouping together students with similar educational and career goals.

There are currently four different living-learning communities on campus: “Le Quartier Français,” focusing on French language immersion; “Greenhouse,” which seeks new ways to implement sustainable living; “Santé,” focused on improving the health of disadvantaged or impoverished people through community service; and “Node,” which is centered on technology.

CCL also implements what they call a “Trek Curriculum.” The programs available at the college are all designed to nurture each and every student’s career, culture, and community.

Centenary College of Louisiana is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.

Bowdoin currently supports 33 majors and four minors. The school has no fraternities or sororities on campus. Instead, students are assigned to a house upon acceptance. The house is correlated with their freshman dorm assignments. House affiliations remain, even when students move off campus or graduate.

<em>U.S. News &amp; World Report</em> named Bowdoin the #4 Best Liberal Arts College in America. The college has also been rewarded with some less conventional plaudits: For example, <em>Princeton Review</em> named the on-campus dining service the best in the country!

Arguably one of the most culturally relevant campuses in the country, Bowdoin is where Harriet Beecher Stowe began writing <em>Uncle Tom’s Cabin,</em> while her husband was a professor there. Some famous alumni include author Nathaniel Hawthorne, poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and U.S. President Franklin Pierce.

The University of Pennsylvania, universally known as “Penn,” is a private, research university located on the near West side of Philadelphia. Founded in 1740 by Benjamin Franklin, the 992-acre campus is a member of the Ivy League and one of the nine colonial colleges founded before the American Revolution.

Visitors and residents are often impressed by the university’s Gothic buildings, which are modeled after those found at Cambridge and Oxford. The current student body totals a little over 21,000 students, and is divided about half and half between undergraduates and graduate students.

Penn is acclaimed for its series of firsts, including the first medical and business schools in North America. It was also one of the first universities in this country to adopt a multidisciplinary approach, which makes it popular among students looking for the resources of a university coupled with a more liberal arts teaching style and atmosphere. On a less solemn note, the Penn marching band was the first to be featured in the annual Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade!

Penn’s undergraduate program accepts, on average, 12 percent of applicants, making it the sixth-most-selective university in the U.S., according to <em>Princeton Review.</em>

Today, the college has a student enrollment of nearly 1600 individuals.

Swarthmore, which occupies a 399-acre campus, was organized by some of the most prominent names in the abolitionist movement, including Lucretia Mott. The school is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, along with Bryn Mawr College and Haverford College, allowing students to register for classes at any of the three colleges. Swarthmore is also affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania, which allows the college’s students to register for classes at Penn, as well.

Apart from the many liberal arts degrees available, Swarthmore has an engineering program, which is rare for a smaller liberal arts school. With all of these advantages, it is easy to understand why the college is highly selective, admitting only 14 percent of applicants. Students who are admitted will have 100 percent of their demonstrated need covered by financial aid. According to <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report</em>, Swarthmore is the third-best liberal arts college in the country.

Brown University is a private, research university located in Providence, Rhode Island. Established in 1764, it is the seventh-oldest higher education institution in the United States, and boasts the oldest undergraduate engineering program in the country. It was also the first university to accept students regardless of religious affiliation.

The 143-acre urban campus, which makes this Ivy League university the largest landowner is the city of Providence, is educational home to 8,540 students. Brown accepts only eight percent of applicants, making it one of the hardest of all American universities to get into. Applications are read in a need-blind manner, which removes the possibility of acceptance or denial based on socioeconomic status. Brown has eliminated loans for all students who come from families with an annual income of less than $100,000, and any expected parental contributions from families with an annual income of less than $60,000.

<em>Princeton Review</em> recently named Brown America’s Happiest College, and <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report</em> ranks it as the #15 Best University in the United States.

Originally an all-male military college, today Clemson University is a public, land-grant and sea-grant, coeducational, research university located in Clemson, South Carolina, southwest of Greenville. The school was founded by the South Carolina legislature in 1889 with money left to the state for that purpose in the will of Thomas Green Clemson. Clemson’s fortune largely derived from his wife, Anna Maria Calhoun Clemson, who was the daughter of statesman, philosopher, and seventh Vice President of the United States, John C. Calhoun.

The university contains five Colleges: Agriculture, Forestry, and Life Sciences; Architecture, Arts, and Humanities; Business and Behavioral Sciences; Engineering and Science; and Health, Education, and Human Development. Collectively, the Colleges offer more than 80 undergraduate degrees, 75 minors, and 110 graduate degrees.

Clemson has a current undergraduate enrollment of almost 17,000 students, and a graduate enrollment of a little over 4,000. While the school has a fairly large number of students in attendance, it also has a large number of faculty members, thus assuring that professors have time to be available to their students. The university currently maintains a student-to-faculty ration of 16-to-one.

The 17,000-acre campus nestled in the foothills of the iconic Blue Ridge Mountains is the perfect location for Clemson’s many interesting traditions. For example, Tigerama is an annual, student-led pep rally—the largest in the nation, with over 40,000 in attendance. <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report</em> ranks Clemson #21 among National Public Universities.

Clemson University is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges.

The University of Virginia (UVA) is a public, research university whose flagship campus is located in Charlottesville, a town northwest of Richmond not far from Shenandoah National Park in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Established in 1819, the university was conceived and planned by Thomas Jefferson. The third President also designed and oversaw construction of several of the buildings on campus, notably the iconic Rotunda, which he modeled after the Pantheon in Rome, and which was one of the largest buildings in North America at the time. Jefferson also insisted that UVA not be affiliated with any particular religious group—something highly unusual for the times. The university is one of the eight original “Public Ivies,” and one of the very few Southern universities that remained open throughout the Civil War.

UVA is divided into 14 individual Schools and offers 51 bachelor’s degrees in 47 fields, 81 master’s degrees in 65 fields, and 57 doctoral degrees in 55 fields. The school accepts fewer than 30 percent of applicants. In solidarity with Jefferson’s principles, students at the University of Virginia do not “graduate”; instead they “take their degree.” This represents Jefferson’s belief that learning is a lifelong process with no end.

<em>U.S. News &amp; World Repor</em>t considers UVA to be the #23 Best National University in the country.

The University of Virginia is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.

If a student is accused of such an offense, he will stand trail and be judged by a group of his peers. Hampden-Sydney Students are expected to complete a rigorous core curriculum on top of their major specific course work. <em>Forbes</em> ranked Hampden-Sydney College as the #4 Best College in the South.

Hampden-Sydney College is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges.

Unlike the other four-year colleges on this list, the University of Wyoming-Casper College Center is actually a partnership between a university (the University of Wyoming—see the previous entry) and a two-year community college (Casper College). The classes fulfill a need for higher education options in central Wyoming for students who are not able to relocate to a four-year university.

Casper College Center classes take place on the campus of Casper College, under the auspices of the University of Wyoming. Most students enrolled in classes at the Center have obligations, such as jobs or children, which prevent them from relocating to the University of Wyoming’s main campus at Laramie. Founded in 1976, the Center is dedicated to small class sizes, which provide hands-on experience in the classroom and the field, as well as to community service and an impressive lecture series.

The Center has countless partnerships with local businesses and corporations, which provide students with a wealth of internship options and potential future employers. Thus, the Center helps students to realize their potential and to gain the work experience required to succeed. The University of Wyoming currently offers 17 undergraduate and 12 graduate degree programs at its Center on the campus of Casper College.
